<h3>Laravel 9.x</h3>

This is a basic MVC structure experimentation in Laravel 9.x

The project can be run using <h6>command prompt</h6>. 
You can go to the root directory of the laravel project and run php artisan serve....

This project gives the basic understanding on how the laravel works purely based on the structure of laravel.

There are several loops and functions that are commented out. 
It will help to understand how the code was refined.

Greeting is a simple blog post. Where the data is created manually and fetched without a database.

Things to learn:

-Connection without Xampp or other services.
-How to coonect MVC and what code to write where.
-How to clean up the code.
-What functions laravel provide.
-Laravel Blade and components.

It gives a basic understanding of Laravel.

Hope this helps!!!!

Thank You.
